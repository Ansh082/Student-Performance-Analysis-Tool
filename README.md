# Student-Performance-Analysis-Tool
This tool can help educators and students understand performance trends, identify areas for improvement, and make data-driven decisions.
Features:
1. Data Importing: Allow users to import student performance data from CSV files.
2. Data Cleaning: Implement functions to handle missing data and correct data types.
3. Descriptive Statistics: Calculate and display basic statistics like mean, median, mode, and standard deviation for student scores.
4. Data Visualization: Use libraries like Matplotlib and Seaborn to create visualizations such as:
Line charts to show trends over time.
5. Correlation Analysis: Analyze the correlation between different subjects to identify patterns.
6. Predictive Analysis: Implement a simple linear regression model to predict future performance based on historical data.
7. User Interface: Develop a simple GUI using Tkinter or a web-based interface using Flask for ease of use.

Tools and Libraries:
Pandas: For data manipulation and analysis.
NumPy: For numerical operations.
Matplotlib/Seaborn: For data visualization.
Scikit-learn: For implementing machine learning models.
Tkinter/Flask: For creating the user interface.


# Following is the code for the tool

import pandas as pd

# Load the CSV file into a DataFrame
data = pd.read_csv('student_scores.csv')

# Display the first few rows of the DataFrame
print("Data Preview:")
print(data.head())

# Calculate the average score
average_score = data['score'].mean()

# Print the average score
print(f"\nThe average score of the students is: {average_score:.2f}")
